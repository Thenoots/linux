SPEAr cpufreq driver
-------------------

SPEAr SoC cpufreq driver for CPU frequency scaling.
It supports both uniprocessor (UP) and symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems
which share clock across all CPUs.

Required properties:
- compatible: "st,cpufreq-spear"
- cpufreq_tbl: Table of frequencies CPU could be transitioned into, in the
  increasing order.

Optional properties:
- clock-latency: Specify the possible maximum transition latency for clock, in
  unit of nanoseconds.

Examples:
--------

cpufreq {
	compatible = "st,cpufreq-spear";
	cpufreq_tbl = < 166000
			200000
			250000
			300000
			400000
			500000
			600000 >;
};
