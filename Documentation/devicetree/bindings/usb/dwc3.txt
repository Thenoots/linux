Synopsys DesignWareCores SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Controller

The device node for a USB3 Wrapper that is part of an OMAP5 SoC is as described
in the document "Open Firmware Recommended Practice: Universal Serial Bus" with
the following modifications and additions:

Required properties:
	- compatible : should be "ti,omap5-dwc3" or "ti,omap5430-dwc3".
	- reg : the first address and length contains the address of DRD. The
		second address and length contains the address of the wrapper.
	- interrupts : < a b > where 'a' is the interrupt number and 'b' is a
		field that represents an encoding of the sense and level
		information for the interrupt line.
	- child device : The child Synopsys DesignWareCore USB 3.0 DRD Controller

Optional properties:
	- utmi_mode : UTMI mode of the wrapper Interrupts (SW or HW). Refer to
		OMAP5 TRM for more details (for TI wrapper only)

Example of hardware mode OMAP5:

	usb@4a020000 {
		#address-cells = < 1 >;
		#size-cells = < 1 >;
		compatible = "ti,omap5430-dwc3", "ti,omap5-dwc3";
		interrupt-parent = < &intc >;
		interrupts = < 93 4 >;
		reg = < 0x4a020000 0x10000 >;
		utmi_mode = "hardware";
		range;

		usb@4a030000 {
			#address-cells = < 3 >;
			#size-cells = < 3 >;
			compatible = "synopsys,dwc3";
			interrupt-parent = < &intc >;
			interupts = < 92 4 >;
			reg = <	0x4a030000 0x8000       // First address is xHCI
				0x4a03c100 0x600        // Second is Global
				0x4a03c700 0x500 >;     // Third is Device
		};
	};

Example of software mode OMAP5:

	usb@4a020000 {
		#address-cells = < 1 >;
		#size-cells = < 1 >;
		compatible = "ti,omap5430-dwc3", "ti,omap5-dwc3";
		interrupt-parent = < &intc >;
		interrupts = < 93 4 >;
		reg = < 0x4a020000 0x10000 ;
		utmi_mode = "software";
		range;

		usb@4a030000 {
			#address-cells = < 3 >;
			#size-cells = < 3 >;
			compatible = "synopsys,dwc3";
			interrupt-parent = < &intc >;
			interupts = < 92 4 >;
			reg = <	0x4a030000 0x8000       // First address is xHCI
				0x4a03c100 0x600        // Second is Global
				0x4a03c700 0x500 >;     // Third is Device
		};
	};
